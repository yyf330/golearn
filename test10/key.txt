Scanner provides a convenient interface for reading data such as a file of newline-delimited lines of text Successive
calls to the Scan method will step through the tokens of a file skipping the bytes between the tokens The specification
of a token is defined by a split function of type SplitFunc the default split function breaks the input into lines with
line termination stripped Split functions are defined in this package for scanning a file into lines bytes UTF-8-encoded
runes and space-delimited words The client may instead provide a custom split function
